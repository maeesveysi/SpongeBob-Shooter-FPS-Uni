mat_hb01_shadow_KK
mat_hb01_shadow_mesa

========================================================================================================
The DAE and FBX models do not need their alpha textures manually readded to the respected materials.

Additionally, the DAE or FBX files are the recommended file format to use as they have the meshes
organized into groups/layers while OBJ does not have that capability.
